# 🇦🇹 Austrian Retirement Dashboard

A personal finance dashboard designed to help you plan for early retirement in Austria.

## 🎯 Purpose

Retiring early in Austria comes with a specific challenge: the "Gap Years" between your early retirement date and the official state pension age (65). This dashboard helps you visualize your financial runway during this gap and beyond.

## ✨ Features

- **Asset Tracking**: Monitor your Net Worth across Cash, Stocks, and Real Estate.
- **Income Management**: Track monthly rental income or other side hustles.
- **Gap Calculation**: Automatically calculates your monthly budget for two distinct phases:
    1.  **Early Retirement Phase**: Living off assets + rental income.
    2.  **Pension Phase (65+)**: Assets + rental income + State Pension.
- **Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR)**: Interactive slider to adjust your annual withdrawal rate (e.g., 3.5% or 4%) and see the immediate impact on your monthly budget.
- **Net Worth Projection**: A detailed year-by-year projection table showing how your wealth evolves up to age 100 based on your spending and investment returns.
- **Privacy First**: All data is stored locally in your browser (`localStorage`). No data is sent to any server.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Vite**: Fast build tool and dev server.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Lightweight and fast, no heavy framework overhead.
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Modern, utility-first styling for a premium dark-mode aesthetic.
